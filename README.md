This is a repository that will explain the Anti-Cheat checks of a popular server known as Mineplex. Mineplex Bedrock Edition uses a very old Anti-Cheat named Gwen, the Anti-Cheat is extremely easy to bypass as long as you avoid the few checks the Anti-Cheat has.


Gwen check 1: Y-Check or Fly Check

Gwen can only flag a flying player if it flies above the block level where it took off and not fall down for a short span of time, for example, if I was to fly from one island to another and not go above the level of the block I flew from, then Gwen will ne be able to detect me.
